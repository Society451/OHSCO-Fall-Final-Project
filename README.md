# HSC-Final-Project

Final project for History and Philosophy of Science (sophomore Core at Stanford Online High School).

Used `three.js` for the model.

Special thanks to Diana McDermott (Teaching Assistant) for model design and concept help. I promise I'll get you those GitHub keycaps one day.

This is supposed to be an interractive, 3D model of the Aristotelian solar system, so NO I'm not some weirdo who thinks the Earth is at the center of the universe.
